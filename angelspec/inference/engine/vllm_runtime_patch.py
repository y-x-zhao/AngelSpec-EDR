"""Runtime injection of EAGLE3 / extract_hidden_states support into vLLM models.

vLLM's ``extract_hidden_states`` speculative method requires the target model's
inner ``Model`` class to inherit ``EagleModelMixin`` and call
``_maybe_add_hidden_state`` inside its decoder-layer loop, and the outer
``ForCausalLM`` class to satisfy the ``SupportsEagle3`` protocol. Upstream
achieves this by editing each model file. To avoid patching the installed vLLM
source, this module re-registers an enhanced subclass at runtime.

The injection runs inside **every** vLLM process (driver, engine core, and—via
``vllm.general_plugins`` entry point—each spawned worker) because the Eagle3
capability check (``gpu_model_runner._maybe_setup_eagle3``) executes in the
worker after the model is built.

Design notes:
  - The inner Model is decorated with ``@support_torch_compile``. Subclassing it
    and overriding ``forward`` is safe: the decorator compiles ``self.forward``
    (see ``compilation/decorators.py`` ``__call__``), so the subclass override
    becomes the traced function while the wrapped ``__init__`` / ``__call__`` are
    inherited unchanged.
  - The outer ForCausalLM subclass mixes in ``SupportsEagle`` / ``SupportsEagle3``
    (runtime_checkable protocols, attribute-based isinstance) and propagates the
    ``(hidden_states, aux_hidden_states)`` tuple returned by the enhanced Model.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Per-model EAGLE3 forward overrides
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# IMPORTANT: this injection is NOT a generic "works on any model" transform.
# Each target model's inner ``Model.forward`` has its own calling conventions
# (decoder-layer signature, fused vs. plain final norm, aux-capture start index,
# embedding helper name, ...). A forward body copied from one model will, at
# best, raise on another and, at worst, *silently* capture the wrong residual
# stream — which corrupts training data without any error.
#
# Therefore each model that does NOT already ship EAGLE3 support (most models in
# vLLM >= 0.10 already do; those are detected and skipped) must register an
# explicit forward override here, faithfully mirroring its own upstream forward
# plus the two ``_maybe_add_hidden_state`` calls and the aux-tuple return.
#
# To add a new model:
#   1. Read the model's inner ``Model.forward`` in vLLM source.
#   2. Write a ``<model>_inner_forward(self, ...)`` mirroring it, inserting
#      ``self._maybe_add_hidden_state([], <start>, hs, residual)`` before the
#      layer loop and ``self._maybe_add_hidden_state(aux, <idx>+1, hs, residual)``
#      inside it, and returning ``(hidden_states, aux)`` when aux is non-empty.
#   3. Add an entry to ``_EAGLE3_TARGETS`` pointing ``forward`` at it.
#   4. Add the HF ``model_type`` to ``_EXTRA_AUX_MODEL_TYPES``.

    """EAGLE3 forward for ``HYV3Model`` (Hy3 / hy_v3).

    Mirrors ``vllm.model_executor.models.hy_v3.HYV3Model.forward`` exactly,
    with auxiliary hidden-state capture added. Hy3 specifics preserved:
      - decoder layer takes an ``idx=`` keyword argument
      - final norm: the vLLM fork's ``HYV3Model`` switches on
        ``VLLM_PRECISION_MODE``. In ``"HF"`` mode ``self.norm`` is a plain
        single-input RMSNorm and the residual is added manually beforehand
        (the path this override mirrors); in ``"default"`` mode it is the fused
        two-input ``self.norm(hidden, residual)``. We force ``"HF"`` for hy_v3
        targets in ``vllm_engine.py``, so
        the HF branch below is the authoritative one. The ``"default"`` branch
        is mirrored too for safety, in case the env is set elsewhere.

    NOTE: the fork's forward also has a ``get_tpsp_ctx()`` sequence-parallel
    chunk/all-gather path. AngelSpec hidden-state extraction runs the target at
    tp=1 (see the DFlash-family configs), where
    ``get_tpsp_ctx()`` is ``None`` and that path is a no-op, so it is omitted
    here. If a hy_v3 target is ever served at tp>1 for extraction, this body
    must be extended to mirror the tpsp chunk/all-gather.

      3. Re-register ``Qwen3ForCausalLM`` with a subclass whose weight loader skips
         the co-located ``mtp.*`` keys. The MTP head lives in the SAME dir as the
