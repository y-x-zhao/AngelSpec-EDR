# DFly

DFly (DFlareV2) combines the best of [DFlash](dflash.md) and [DFlare](dflare.md): DFlash's
shared-KV context efficiency with DFlare's learnable per-layer target fusion, plus an optional
hidden-state correction head.

## What changes over DFlare

1. **Shared FC context + fusion residual.** DFlash's shared fully-connected context projection
   is kept as the base signal. DFlare's per-layer fusion weights are applied as a *residual* on
   top, rather than replacing the shared context entirely. This gives the model a strong
   initialization (shared context ≈ DFlash) while retaining the expressiveness of per-layer
   adaptation.

2. **Hidden-state correction (optional).** An autoregressive head that applies a per-layer
   residual correction to the draft hidden states before the final `lm_head` projection. This
   addresses the mismatch between the draft model's shallow representations and the target
   model's deeper ones. Enabled via `enable_hidden_correction: true` in the draft config.

3. **Markov head disabled by default.** Unlike [DSpark](dspark.md), DFly does not use the
   low-rank bigram Markov bias (`markov_rank: 0`), relying solely on the attention-based
   prediction path.

## Configuration

DFly uses its own `DFlyConfig` (an extension of `DFlashConfig`) and the
`"Qwen3DFlyModel"` architecture. It is a DFlash-family drafter and does not
depend on DSpark. The hidden-states correction knobs
(`enable_hidden_correction`, `hidden_correction_intermediate_size`) belong to
DFly only:

```json
{
  "architectures": ["Qwen3DFlyModel"],
  "model_type": "qwen3",
  "enable_hidden_correction": true
}
```

## Dispatch

The trainer dispatches on the `DFlyConfig` type:

- **Model:** `DFlyDraftModel` (in `angelspec/models/draft/dfly.py`)
- **Trainer:** `DFlyTrainer` (in `angelspec/training/dfly_trainer.py`) — a thin
  subclass of `DFlashTrainer` that swaps in the `DFlyModel` wrapper (in
  `angelspec/models/dfly.py`) via the DFlash model-build hooks. Reads the
  `dflash_*` hyperparameter namespace.
- **Loss:** Inherits the DFlash composable loss (CE + decay/D-PACE + optional KL/LK,
  plus an optional independent end-to-end multi-step TV term)
